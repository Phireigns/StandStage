<h2>Visual Paradigm</h2>
It is a set of principles, conventions, and frameworks that shape the way visual elements are organized and presented in various mediums. It encompasses the rules and guidelines that govern the arrangement of visual elements such as color, composition, typography, and imagery to communicate meaning, evoke emotions, and engage the audience. Visual paradigms provide a common language and structure for visual communication, enabling designers and artists to create coherent and effective visual experiences across different contexts and mediums.
